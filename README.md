## Assignment Details:

- Set up a React.js project with TypeScript.
- Implement CRUD operations for the board.
- Utilize reusable components to enhance modularity and efficiency.
- Integrate React Hooks Forms for form handling, ensuring smooth data management.
- Additional features or enhancements are welcome to showcase your skills and creativity.

## Implemented features added

- Ensure the app adjusts to fit any screen size
- Display hover effects for all interactive elements
- Allow users to create, view, modify, and delete boards and tasks
- Provide validation messages for form errors during the creation or editing of boards and tasks
- Enable users to complete subtasks and relocate tasks across columns
- Include an option to toggle the visibility of the board sidebar
- Offer a choice to switch between light and dark themes
- Bonus: Facilitate task reordering and status updates through drag-and-drop functionality
- Bonus: Maintain persistence of user changes, using localStorage for data storage

### Expected Behaviour added

- Boards
  - Clicking different boards in the sidebar will change to the selected board.
  - Clicking "Create New Board" in the sidebar opens the "Add New Board" modal.
  - Clicking in the dropdown menu "Edit Board" opens up the "Edit Board" modal where details can be changed.
  - Columns are added and removed for the Add/Edit Board modals.
  - Deleting a board deletes all columns and tasks and requires confirmation.
- Columns
  - A board needs at least one column before tasks can be added. If no columns exist, the "Add New Task" button in the header is disabled.
  - Clicking "Add New Column" opens the "Edit Board" modal where columns are added.
- Tasks
  - Adding a new task adds it to the bottom of the relevant column.
  - Updating a task's status will move the task to the relevant column. If you're taking on the drag and drop bonus, dragging a task to a different column will also update the status.
